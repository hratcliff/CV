  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
  <p>
    Two of my favourite hobbies are reading and writing.
    I enjoy reading everything from historical accounts to fantasy epics.
    I am also currently working on writing my own stories in the fantasy genere.
    I also enjoy biking through the nature trails around my home.
    Currently I am working on two new hobbies.
    One of them is painting and the other coding.
    Both of them are difficult in different ways but engaging none the less.

  <h3>Favourite Book</h3>
  <p>
    My favourite book changes often when I either revist an old favourite or discover a new one.
My current favourite book is the Lord of the Rings by J.K Toilken.
The story contains many fansty elemnt staples however the underlying lessons speak to the heart of a person.
In particular the lesson that it is often the humble, kind and underestimated good in the world that can topple tyranny.
This gives me hope in my own life when I feel the pressure as a teacher to help children in the small amount of time I have them to try and gain resiliency for what they may face in their own lives.

  <h3>Favourite Show</h3>
  <p>
  I am currently inspired by the disney series Star Wars: Clone Wars.
  Every episode begins with a piece of wisdom that relates to the story.
  Most stories show character growth and development.
  I enjoy this because it reminds me while I work on new skills their is a purpose for all experieces.
  This could be anything from persevering through a challenging coding problem or willing the body to push through a diffcult hil when cycyling.

<h3>Favourite Song</h3>
<p>
The song i consistently play again is funny enough many songs in one, Decade of Pop by DJ Eartworm.
As a habitual switch the radio in a middle of a song person this one works for me as I can listen to the best bits of many.
I also enjoy nestolgia and the fact that it makes me feel motivated to work. Like a coffee this is my pick me up.
